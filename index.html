            <p>Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, south of India, separated by the Palk Strait. Its closest neighboring country is the Maldives, situated to the southwest.

The country experiences a tropical climate with the Southwest Monsoon (Yala) from May to September and the Northeast Monsoon (Maha) from December to February. Renowned for its rich biodiversity, Sri Lanka is home to dense forests, diverse wildlife, and famous national parks such as Yala, Wilpattu, Udawalawe, and Horton Plains. Administratively, the country is divided into 9 provinces and 25 districts. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte serves as the administrative capital, while Colombo is the commercial hub.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka has a rich and diverse history dating back over 2,500 years. The island's historical records begin with the arrival of Prince Vijaya from North India around 543 BCE, establishing the first known kingdom in Anuradhapura. <br>This era marked the beginning of Sinhalese civilization, heavily influenced by Buddhism, which was introduced by Arahat Mahinda during King Devanampiya Tissa's reign in the 3rd century BCE. <br>Anuradhapura thrived as a center of culture and religion for over a millennium.

                In the 10th century CE, the Chola Empire from South India invaded, leading to the decline of Anuradhapura and the rise of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom. <br>This era saw great architectural and irrigation advancements. Following internal conflicts and South Indian invasions, the capital shifted to Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Gampola, and finally Kotte.
                
                By the 16th century, European colonization began with the arrival of the Portuguese (1505), followed by the Dutch (1658), who controlled the coastal regions. In 1796, the British took over, and by 1815, they conquered the Kandyan Kingdom, unifying the entire island under British rule. The country was known as Ceylon during this period.
                
                Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain on February 4, 1948, but remained a dominion within the British Commonwealth until it became a republic in 1972, adopting the name Sri Lanka. Post-independence, ethnic tensions between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority escalated, leading to a civil war in 1983 with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fighting for a separate state. The war lasted for nearly 26 years, ending in 2009 with the defeat of the LTTE.
                
                Since then, Sri Lanka has focused on reconstruction, reconciliation, and economic development, while navigating political challenges. Its history reflects a blend of ancient kingdoms, colonial influences, and modern-day transformations.</p>
